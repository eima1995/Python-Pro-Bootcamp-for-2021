#  Day 56 - Intermediate+ Rendering HTML/Static files and Using templates


Final Project - Name Card Website Template

We're going to be using one of the templates on HTML 5 Up to create a web-based name card. Like the old-school paper ones, but better.

1. Take a look at the live demo here: https://html5up.net/identity

2. Create a new PyCharm project called name-card and create a new Flask Application from scratch.

3. Create the necessary folders and move the relevant files from the download in step1.

4. Get the website to work when you access the root route ("/")

5. Personalise the website, change the background image, change the text, change the links, make it your own.

This is what you're aiming for:


## Installing
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
set FLASK_APP=server.py
```

Run server
```sh
python -m flask run
```
